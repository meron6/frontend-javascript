Got it! You want a **`README.md`** file for your **`task_0` TypeScript project**. Here's a clean and professional version you can use:

# Task 0: Creating an Interface for a Student

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic TypeScript concepts, including:

- Defining an interface
- Creating objects that follow the interface
- Storing objects in an array
- Manipulating the DOM using TypeScript

The task renders a table in the browser showing the first name and location of each student.

## Project Structure

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the task directory:
```bash
cd 0x04-TypeScript/task_0
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project using Webpack:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Open `dist/index.html` in your browser to view the table of students.

---

## Student Interface

```ts
interface Student {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
  location: string;
}
```

Two students are created and stored in an array:

```ts
const studentsList: Student[] = [student1, student2];
```

Each student's **first name** and **location** is displayed in the table.

## Author

* Your Name
* ALX TypeScript Project

```

If you want, I can also **create a minimal `index.html`** to put in `dist/` so when you run `npm run build` the table automatically appears in the browser. This is often required for the reviewers to see your output.  

Do you want me to do that?
